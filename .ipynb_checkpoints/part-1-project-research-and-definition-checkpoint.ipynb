    "dengue viruses transmitted by mosquitoes, primarily the <i>Aedes</i> mosquito (pictured above).  The principal symptoms of dengue fever are high fever, severe headache, severe pain behind the eyes, rash, mild nose and gum bleeding, and \n",
    "muscle, joint and bone pain.  5% of those infected develop a more severe case of dengue fever, characterised by persistent vomiting, \n",
    "severe abdominal pain, difficulty breathing and internal bleeding, which can lead to failure of the circulatory system and death.  Symptoms of infection usually begin 4-7 days after the mosquito bite and typically last 3-10 days.  When infected, early recognition, and prompt supportive treatment can substantially lower the risk of medical complications and death.\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to global warming, decreased heavy pesticide use due to environmental concerns and the <i>Aedes</i> mosquito’s preference for urban environments, the number and severity of dengue infections has increased since the second world war. With a 30-fold increase between 1960 and 2010, it is now 20 times more common than the flu.  2.5 billion people, or 40% of the world's population, live in areas where there is a risk of dengue transmission.  Dengue is currently endemic (i.e. infections are reported every year) in at least 100 countries (compared to 9 countries in 1970) in Asia, the Pacific, the Americas, Africa and the Caribbean, and it's the leading causes of illness and death in the tropics and subtropics.  As many as 400 million people are infected yearly.  The Sri Lankan Ministry of Health reported 61,844 cases of dengue fever in 2017 as of June 13, while Brazil reported almost 1.5 million cases in 2016.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no vaccine to prevent infection from the dengue viruses and there are no medications to treat a dengue infection.  The most effective protective measures are therefore those that avoid mosquito bites.  This includes the elimination of places where mosquitoes lay their eggs, primarily artificial containers that hold water; requiring regular cleaning of vases, pet watering containers and covering water storage tanks etc.  Using air conditioning or window and door screens prevent mosquitoes coming indoors, and application of appropriate repellents also reduce the risk of being bitten by mosquitoes."

    "<i>Aedes</i> mosquito (pictured above) that is infected with a dengue virus.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Once infected, humans become the main carriers and multipliers of the virus, serving as a source of the virus for uninfected mosquitoes.  A mosquito becomes infected with dengue virus when it bites a person who has dengue virus in their blood.  In order for transmission to the mosquito to occur, it must bite an infected person during a 5 day period when large amounts of the virus are in the person's blood; this period usually begins before the person becomes symptomatic.  An infected person may not always exhibit symptoms of dengue virus.  In any case, approximately 7-12 days after biting an infected person, a mosquito can then transmit the virus to healthy people.  The mosquito remains infected with the dengue virus for the duration of its life, which may be days or a few weeks. \n",
    "\n",
    "Dengue cannot be spread from person to person.\n",

    "## Where can outbreaks occur?\n",
    "Outbreaks of dengue fever occur primarily in areas where <i>Aedes</i> mosquitoes live, which includes most tropical urban areas in the world.  In many parts of the tropics and subtropics, dengue is endemic; this is, it occurs every year, usually during a season when <i>Aedes</i> mosquito populations are high, and often when rainfall is optimal for breeding.  In areas where dengue is endemic, incidence follows seasonal transmission patterns punctuated every few years by much larger epidemics, when large numbers of people become infected during a short period of time.  Dengue epidemics require a coincidence of a large number of mosquito carriers, large numbers of people with no immunity to one of the four virus types, and the opportunity for contact between the two.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dengue viruses may also be introduced into areas by travellers who became infected while visiting other areas of the tropics where dengue commonly exists however, introduction of the virus into new areas also requires the presence of the <i>Aedes</i> mosquito, and it is this limiting factor which has largely contained the virus to tropical and subtropical areas.  \n",

    "## What factors influence dengue incidence?\n",
    "\n",
    "The <i>Aedes</i> mosquito, the principal vector of dengue viruses in an insect closely related to humans and their dwellings.  People not only provide the mosquitoes with blood meals, but they also provide water containers in and around their home, which are needed by mosquitoes to complete their development.  <i>Aedes</i> mosquitoes can lay their eggs in a single drop of water.  Homes also provide the cool, dark places (e.g. cupboards) preferred by mosquitoes.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's very difficult to control or eliminate <i>Aedes</i> mosquitoes because they are highly resilient, and have the ability to rapidly bounce back to initial populations after natural (e.g drought) or man-made (e.g. insecticides) disturbances.  Studies have demonstrated that even after the elimination of all larvae, pupae and adult mosquitoes at once from a site, a mosquito population can fully recover two weeks later as a result of egg hatching after rainfall.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite their resilience, <i>Aedes</i> mosquitoes are cold-blooded, which makes them highly sensitive to environmental conditions.  Temperature, precipitation and humidity are critical to mosquito survival, reproduction and development, which influences their distribution and abundance.  Additionally, warmer temperatures also reduce the time for the mosquito to become infectious after it has bitten a human carrier of the virus.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although environmental factors are important, there are many other factors that influence the prevalence of dengue fever.  The virus must be present, there must be sufficient numbers of humans not immune to the virus and there must be contact between those humans and mosquitoes.  In countries where dengue transmission routinely occurs, short-term changes in weather - particularly temperature, precipitation and humidity - are often correlated with dengue incidence.  These relationships however, do not explain the occurrence of major epidemics in these areas every few years.  A more important regulator of epidemics may be the interplay of the four different dengue viruses, and the level of prior exposure of the human population to each of these.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although climate may play a role in changing dengue incidence and distribution, it's one of many factors, and given its poor correlation with historical changes in incidence and epidemics, its role may be minor.  Other important factors potentially contributing to global changes in dengue incidence and distribution include population growth, urbanisation, lack of sanitation, increased long distance travel, ineffective mosquito control and increased reporting capacity.\n",

Temperatures range from 21 to 33 °C. and the annual average temperature is 26.7 °C. The average annual rainfall in Iquitos is 2,616.2 millimetres.  The rainy summer arrives in November and ends in May. March and April have the heaviest rains and humidity. Although July and August are the driest months, they have some periods of downpours.

By the late 1970s, it was gone from all of Peru. As a result, dengue fever disappeared, too.  However, in nearby Venezuela the mosquito survived, and 10 years later it inevitably returned to Peru.  The first city in Peru where it resurfaced was Iquitos, and the dengue virus soon followed. \n",
